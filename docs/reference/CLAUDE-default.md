# AI Business Opportunity Research System v4.0
*Generated by IdeaForge · 2026-02-20*

## Core Principles

These are persistent values that guide every idea from inception through scoring:

- **Prefer ideas where value is easy to quantify — pay $20, get $1,000**
- **Prioritize ideas that create real impact for underserved people**
- **Novel ideas over variations of what's already been explored**

Every founder, every advisor, and every scoring decision should reflect these principles.

---

## Mission

Discover, evaluate, and validate business opportunities that are:
- 99% automatable with AI agents/tools
- High probability of $5,000/month profit (prefer 99% chance at $5,000 over 50% chance at $100,000)
- Digital-first
- Self-serve (customer buys without talking to anyone)
- Solo operator + AI agents
- <$500 startup cost
- Marketing budget: $100-500/month
- Purpose-driven where possible — prefer ideas that create real impact for underserved people

---

## Novelty Setting: 70%

**EXPLORE MODE:** Prioritize novel, unexpected ideas. Actively penalize similarity to past ideas in idea_memory_active.json. Push into unexplored verticals and business models. If an idea feels "safe" or "obvious," challenge yourself to find something more creative. Reward contrarian thinking and unusual combinations.

---

## Operator Profile

### Background & Advantages
- Product Strategy
- UX Design
- Visual Storytelling
- AI Automation

### Role: Creative Director + Product Strategist ONLY
**You do:** Strategic direction, quality control review, go/no-go decisions, approve marketing content
**You don't do:** Sales calls, manual outreach, account management, hands-on delivery, being the "face"

If an idea requires sales calls or manual selling → automatic reject.

### Constraints
- ~1 day/week total time available
- No existing audience
- Has: domains, hosting, tools, Claude Pro/API access

### Filters
**AVOID:** Crypto, Adult content, Licensed professions

**OK (clarification):**
- Tools for traders/investors (tracking, analysis, alerts, journaling) — no advice, just tools
- Educational content about investing concepts — no specific recommendations

**OPPORTUNITY SIGNALS:** Underserved populations with money, poor UX in existing market, unsexy niches VCs ignore

```
DAILY:
Inbox → Trend Scouts → Competitor Scout → Creative Founders (15 ideas) → Advisors → [Iteration] → Pitch Decks (80%+) → Daily Report

PITCH DECKS (AUTOMATIC FOR 80%+):
1. Read /templates/pitch-deck-template.md
2. Generate deck for TOP 6 ideas scoring 80%+
3. Save to ~/Projects/ai-business-research/pitch-decks/[name]-deck.html (ROOT LEVEL!)

REFLECTION (On Request):
For reflection commands → Read /templates/reflection-commands.md

AI INSIGHTS (On Request):
For insights analysis → Read /templates/ai-insights-template.md
```

---

## Inbox System

### Structure
```
/inbox/
├── ideas/      ← Business ideas
├── research/   ← News, tools, trends
└── processed/  ← Moved here after processing
```

### How It Works
1. Drop file in `/inbox/ideas/` or `/inbox/research/`
2. Daily run processes all files
3. Ideas → developed and evaluated
4. Research → context AND mined for opportunities
5. Files moved to `/processed/`

---

## Input Feed (Seeds & Signals)

Process these items during today's run. Each has a type that determines how to use it:

- **💡 IDEA SEED:** AI homework helper for parents [Education]
- **📰 SIGNAL:** Rising demand for AI tutoring in rural areas [Education]

**Processing rules:**
- 💡 Ideas → Develop and evaluate through the full pipeline
- 📰 Signals → Feed to Trend Scouts as additional context, mine for opportunities
- 📊 Data → Use as evidence in ideation and scoring
- 🔗 URLs → Read, extract insights, mine for business opportunities

---

## Team 1: Trend Scouts

### 🔥 CRITICAL ROLE: Trend Scouts DRIVE Idea Generation

Trends are not just context — they are the PRIMARY INPUT for ideation. The Creative Founders should be reacting to what Trend Scouts find, not generating ideas in a vacuum.

### Agents
| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| `tech_scout` | New AI tools, APIs, platforms (last 48h) — **What's newly possible?** |
| `capability_scout` | Breakthroughs that unlock new products — **What couldn't we build yesterday?** |
| `market_scout` | Gaps, pain points, emerging needs — **Who's underserved?** |
| `ux_gap_scout` | Poor design in existing solutions — **Where's the opportunity?** |
| `acquisition_scout` | New distribution channels — **How can we reach people?** |

### Daily Tasks
1. Process `/inbox/research/` first
2. Search for new AI tools/capabilities (last 24-48h)
3. **Flag specific "idea triggers"** — things that could spawn businesses
4. Identify arbitrage opportunities
5. Flag markets with poor UX
6. Search across DIVERSE verticals (not just B2B SaaS)

7. Actively seek trends in UNEXPLORED verticals — avoid retreading familiar territory

### Output: `trends.json`
```json
{
  "trend": "Description",
  "source": "Where found",
  "idea_trigger": "What business could this enable?",
  "potential_audiences": ["audience1", "audience2"],
  "urgency": "high|medium|low"
}
```

---

## Team 1B: Competitor Scout

### Mission
For every potential opportunity, research existing competition BEFORE idea development.

### Output Per Opportunity
```json
{
  "opportunity": "description",
  "existing_competitors": [
    {"name": "", "what_they_do": "", "pricing": "", "weaknesses": ""}
  ],
  "saturation_level": "oversaturated|competitive|moderate|underserved|blue_ocean",
  "gaps_identified": ["gap1", "gap2"],
  "differentiation_angle": "how we'd be different",
  "barrier_to_entry": "low|medium|high"
}
```

### Saturation Rules
- **Oversaturated**: 10+ well-funded competitors, no clear gap → SKIP
- **Competitive**: Several competitors but clear differentiation possible → PROCEED WITH CAUTION
- **Moderate**: Few competitors, obvious gaps → GOOD
- **Underserved**: 1-2 weak competitors or none → GREAT
- **Blue Ocean**: No one doing this yet, clear need → EXCELLENT

---

## Team 2: Creative Founders

### The Founding Team

This isn't a committee — it's a **founding team** with complementary skills who build on each other's ideas. Each founder has a distinct background that shapes how they see opportunities.

### 💡 COLLABORATIVE IDEATION PROCESS

**The founders don't work in silos. They build on each other.**

#### Phase 1: Seeding (Individual)
Each founder generates 2-3 raw ideas based on today's trends through their unique lens.

#### Phase 2: Building (Pairs)
Founders pair up to strengthen ideas — combining perspectives for stronger concepts.

#### Phase 3: Challenging (Full Team)
The full team stress-tests the top ideas. Each founder asks their signature question. Ideas get strengthened, not killed. Look for "yes, and..." not "no, because..."

#### Phase 4: Final Selection
Select 15 ideas that:
- Survived the gauntlet
- Represent diverse approaches
- Include at least 6 trend-driven ideas
- Include at least 4 wild cards
- **NOVELTY CHECK:** At least 50% of ideas must be in verticals or business models NOT seen in idea_memory_active.json

### Acquisition Must Be Automated

**GOOD:** SEO/content, Paid ads, Marketplace listings, Affiliate programs, Email sequences, Viral mechanics

**BAD (auto-reject):** Cold calling, Sales demos, LinkedIn outreach, Networking, Enterprise sales

---

### Quality Filters

**Auto-REJECT (real blockers):**
- Requires sales calls or demos → REJECT
- Requires manual outreach → REJECT
- >$500 startup cost → REJECT
- Requires licenses (legal/medical/financial advice) → REJECT
- Requires existing audience → REJECT
- No sales calls or demos → REJECT
- 95%+ automatable → REJECT
- Solo founder friendly → REJECT

**Soft Filters (penalize but don't auto-reject):**

### 🚨 GTM Advisor Deep Dive

**The GTM Advisor has VETO POWER on acquisition strategy.**

An idea with a weak or unrealistic GTM plan cannot score above 75%, regardless of how good the product is.

**GTM Advisor evaluates:**

#### 1. Time to First Paying Customer
| Rating | Timeline | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 🟢 Excellent | <30 days | Paid ads + landing page, launch sequence |
| 🟡 Good | 30-60 days | Community seeding + launch + early ads |
| 🟠 Slow | 60-120 days | Content marketing + SEO starting to work |
| 🔴 Too Slow | 120+ days | Pure SEO, no paid/organic acceleration |

#### 2. Acquisition Channel Reality Check
| Channel | AI-Automatable? | Speed | Best For |
|---------|-----------------|-------|----------|
| **Paid Social (Meta/TikTok)** | ✅ AI creative | Days | B2C, visual products |
| **Google Search Ads** | ✅ High | Days | High-intent searches |
| **Product Hunt/Launch** | ✅ Medium | Day 1 spike | Dev tools, productivity |
| **Reddit/Communities** | ✅ Needs authenticity | 2-4 weeks | Niche audiences |
| **Influencer/UGC** | ✅ AI outreach | 2-4 weeks | Consumer, lifestyle |
| **Newsletter sponsors** | ✅ High | 1-2 weeks | Targeted niches |
| **Programmatic SEO** | ✅ AI content | 2-4 months | Long-term, high volume |
| **Viral/PLG** | ⚠️ Product-dependent | Varies | Products with share triggers |
| **Cold email/LinkedIn** | ❌ Not allowed | — | — |


#### 3. Required GTM Stack (Must Be Specific)
Every idea MUST specify actual tools for:

**Ad Creative & Testing:**
- Creatify, AdCreative.ai, Pencil → AI-generated ads
- Foreplay → Ad inspiration library
- Motion, Triple Whale → Analytics

**Landing & Conversion:**
- Framer, Webflow → Fast landing pages
- Unbounce → A/B testing
- Testimonial.to → Social proof

**Outreach & Partnerships:**
- Instantly, Smartlead → Email sequences (partnerships, not cold sales)
- SparkToro → Audience research
- Passionfroot → Creator/newsletter partnerships

**Content & SEO (for long-term, not primary):**
- Surfer, Clearscope → SEO optimization
- Byword, Letterdrop → Programmatic content

**Launch Coordination:**
- Prelaunch.com → Waitlist
- Notion + Zapier → Launch checklist automation

### Scoring Criteria
| Criteria | Weight | 1 (Low) | 3 (Medium) | 5 (High) |
|----------|--------|---------|------------|----------|
| **GTM Strategy** | 30% | Vague/SEO-only/slow | Mixed channels, 60-day path | Specific stack, <30 day path |
| **Automation** | 20% | <80% / high-touch | 80-90% | 95-99% hands-off |
| **Economics** | 20% | Unclear path to $5,000 | Viable | Clear math to $5,000 |
| **Differentiation** | 15% | Me-too | Some angle | Clear moat |
| **Buildability** | 15% | Complex | Moderate | <2 weeks, <$500 startup cost |

### Hard Gates
| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Requires ANY manual sales/demos | → REJECT |
| GTM is "SEO" only with no fast channel | → CAP at 70% |
| No specific GTM tools mentioned | → CAP at 70% |
| Time to first customer >90 days | → CAP at 75% |
| No differentiation in saturated market | → CAP at 75% |

## Iteration Protocol

**Trigger:** Score 65%-79% AND advisor has specific suggestion
**Max:** 1 round

1. Advisors provide specific fix
2. Founders produce v2
3. Re-score (no further iteration)
4. If v2 ≥ 80% → auto pitch deck

---

## Daily Execution

### Pre-Flight Check (Run FIRST, Every Time)

```bash
# 1. Confirm correct project directory
pwd

# 2. Verify pitch-decks folder exists
ls pitch-decks/

# 3. Check/create today's daily folder
mkdir -p research/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

### Sequence
1. **Pre-Flight** (2 min): Run verification above
2. **Inbox** (10 min): Process ideas + research + input feed items
3. **Trend Scouts** (30 min): Diverse verticals
4. **Competitor Scout** (20 min): Research competition
5. **Creative Founders** (60 min): Generate **15 diverse ideas**
6. **Advisor Panel** (60 min): Evaluate all
7. **Iteration** (30 min if triggered)
8. **🚨 PITCH DECKS** (20 min): Generate decks for **TOP 6** ideas scoring 80%+ (see below)
9. **Synthesis** (15 min): Generate daily report
10. **Post-Flight** (2 min): Verify all files in correct locations

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Automatic Pitch Deck Generation

### TOP 6 Rule

After scoring is complete, automatically generate pitch decks for the **TOP 6 highest-scoring ideas that are 80% or above**.

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 90%+ | GREENLIT | ✅ **Include in TOP 6** |
| 80-89% | STRONG CANDIDATE | ✅ **Include in TOP 6** |
| 65%-79% | — | Iterate first, no deck unless reaches 80%+ |
| <65% | — | No deck |

### Selection Process
1. List ALL ideas scoring 80%+
2. Sort by score (highest first)
3. Select TOP 6 for deck generation
4. Note remaining 80%+ ideas in daily report as "Deck Deferred"

---

## Wave-Based Deck Generation (Context Management)

### Wave 1: Top 3 Decks
1. Read `/templates/pitch-deck-template.md`
2. Generate decks for ideas ranked #1, #2, #3
3. Save each to `/pitch-decks/[name]-deck.html`
4. **CHECKPOINT:** Verify 3 decks created:
   ```bash
   ls -la pitch-decks/ | tail -5
   ```

### Wave 2: Next 3 Decks
1. Re-read template (fresh context)
2. Generate decks for ideas ranked #4, #5, #6
3. Save each to `/pitch-decks/[name]-deck.html`
4. **CHECKPOINT:** Verify all 6 decks created

### Validation Pass (After Both Waves)
For each deck, verify:
- [ ] File exists in `/pitch-decks/`
- [ ] Has exactly 12 slides (`class="slide"` appears 12 times)
- [ ] Uses light theme (`background: #ffffff`)
- [ ] No dark theme colors (`#0d1117` appears 0 times)
- [ ] No gradients (`linear-gradient` appears 0 times)

**If any deck fails:** Regenerate that specific deck.

---

## Post-Flight Verification

```bash
# Verify decks in correct location
echo "=== Pitch Decks ===" && ls pitch-decks/*-deck.html | tail -10

# Check for misplaced decks
echo "=== Checking for misplaced decks ===" && find research/daily -name "*-deck.html" 2>/dev/null

# Verify today's daily folder
echo "=== Today's Output ===" && ls research/daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/
```

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: File Locations

### Project Root
```
~/Projects/ai-business-research/
```

### Where to Put Files

| File Type | Location | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Pitch Decks** | `~/Projects/ai-business-research/pitch-decks/` | `pitch-decks/neuromoment-deck.html` |
| **Daily Reports** | `~/Projects/ai-business-research/research/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/` | `research/daily/2026-02-20/daily_report.html` |
| **JSON Data** | `~/Projects/ai-business-research/research/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/` | `research/daily/2026-02-20/ideas.json` |

### Pitch Decks — ALWAYS in Root `/pitch-decks/`

```
~/Projects/ai-business-research/
├── pitch-decks/                    ← ALL pitch decks go here (ROOT LEVEL)
│   ├── [idea-name]-deck.html
│   └── ...
├── research/
│   └── daily/
│       └── YYYY-MM-DD/
│           ├── ideas.json

│   ├── reflection-commands.md
│   └── ai-insights-template.md
├── inbox/
│   ├── ideas/
│   └── research/
└── idea_memory_active.json
```

### ❌ DO NOT:
- Put pitch decks inside `/research/daily/YYYY-MM-DD/pitch-decks/`
- Create a pitch-decks subfolder inside the daily folder
- Put pitch decks anywhere other than the root `/pitch-decks/` folder

### ✅ DO:
- Save ALL pitch decks to `~/Projects/ai-business-research/pitch-decks/`
- Use filename format: `[idea-name-lowercase]-deck.html`
- Generate a deck for EVERY idea scoring 80%+

## Idea Memory System

### Files
- `idea_memory_active.json` — Ideas from last 60 days (loaded every run)
- `idea_memory_archive.json` — Older ideas (not loaded, reference only)

### Deduplication
Before generating new ideas, check against memory:
- Same core concept = skip
- Similar but different angle = note as "variation of X"
- Same vertical, different solution = OK

**NOVELTY ENFORCEMENT:** If an idea is a variation of something in memory, it MUST have a clearly different business model, audience, or core mechanism to qualify. Simple rebranding or minor pivots do not count as novel.
